    <h1>Links</h1>
    <p>This example is about links and <a href="images.html">images</a></p>
    <p>there are 3 types of links which exist.</p>
    <p>these being:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Absolute links <br>these are the most detailed and refer to the complete web address example: <strong>"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML"</strong> <br>
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">Mozilla
            Developer Network</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            Relative links <br> these point to another page on your website view from the current page <br>
            we can link to the extra file by supplying the path like this : <strong>"misc/extras.html"</strong>
            <br><a href="misc/extras.html">extras</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            Root-relative links <br>
            These are similar to relative links but they are relative to the root from the entire website.
            <br>since we are using local html files, we won't be able to expiriment with root-relative links.
        </li>
        <p>the only difference between a root-relative link and a relative links is: one starts with a forward slash, this represent the root of your site.</p>
    </ol>
    <p>targets: 
        <br> we can use the target tag in a link to specifiy where we want the new web page to open.
        if you don't add it, it'll open on the current page by default <br>
        adding a "target = _blank" will make sure the webpage opens on a new tab.
        </p>
        <p>this would look something like this. <a href="images.html" target="_blank">images</a></p>
